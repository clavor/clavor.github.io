                <h1 class="center-title should-bounce">Beginnings</h1>
                <p class="should-bounce">Clavor was born on May 27, 1994, in the city of Denver, Colorado. He grew up alongside his two younger siblings, Jonathan and Freddy. The three of them were always getting in trouble and always made a mess around the house. However, when it came to their hobbies, they were all really passionate about them and got so engulfed into them that it seemed as if their entire personalities changed.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="should-bounce">One day, his grandfather, who the three lived with, brought home a bunch of instruments that their uncle had finished using. Clavor’s uncle was in a band known as the Brotherhood Sunrise, who performed in small clubs and events. While they never became widely known, Clavor had always looked up to the band. Receiving all these instruments used by his role models was exciting. As he tried the instruments one by one, he found himself liking the piano the most. From that day on, Clavor’s house was filled by the music coming from the keyboard in his room. He practiced every day, and even took lessons from one of his Uncle’s band members.</p>

                <h1 class="center-title should-bounce">Rise to Fame</h1>
                <p class="should-bounce">At the age of 12, he began using more technology than just a keyboard. With the help of his uncle, they made their own compact studio inside of his uncle’s garage. With this, he began creating music and added a variety of sounds using his synths and other equipment. Finally, on March 1 of 2011, he released his first song named <i>Salt</i>. This song received a lot of positive feedback and, to his surprise, reached number 3 on ITunes.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="should-bounce">“When I create my titles, they may seem as if I’m just naming them whatever, but these are just things I think of before and during the creation of my songs and I just title them that. It’s sounds absurd, but that’s what really happens,” He said laughing during an interview in 2015.</p>
